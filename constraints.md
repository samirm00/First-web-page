# Constrains

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

- Time

  > Time run fast. We need to run faster.

- Availability

  > Availability is very important for the project to run. 
  > Availability for the group meeting is essential

- Natural causes

  > Any external fact that migh happen that we don't have control on: Headaches, Unplanned babysitting, Sickness, accident, etc.
  > All those can slow us down.

- Language
  > Communication is tough. Sometimes you don't find the proper word to express an idea.

## Internal: Involuntary

- Technology

  > Computer slowing down or getting stuck.
  > We do not master github and VSCode perfectly yet

- Issues

  > Issues might occur. 
  > Try to solve them as soon as possible through communication 

- Interface and/or OS

  > All members of our teams use different OS (Mac, Windows, Linux) making it
  > difficult to help sometimes.

- Troubleshooting
  > Issues we might encounter while working in the workflow due to missuses or
  > mistake of commands or workflow. Can be solved but we need to invest time to
  > investigate.

## Internal: Voluntary

- Communication

  > Depends on time and availability of the teammates and coaches.

- Dependency
  > Team is all about being dependent on each other. Hence we need to work on
  > our own part as soon as possible so we do not create dependency for others.
  
- Work/life balance
  > We all have other matters to attend besides the project making it difficult
  > to be available at all times, and since we all depend of someone else to
  > review our updates or we also require time to discuss in group what we need,
  > that might complicate our efficiency in time.
